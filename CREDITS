The tuning for K-computer is supported by MEXT as Priority Issue 9 to be 
Tackled  by Using Post K Computer "Elucidation of the Fundamental Laws and 
Evolution of the Universe" and JICFuS.  The computational resources of
the K computer was provided by the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational 
Science through the HPCI System Research project (Project ID: hp170229, 
hp180178).  The test configurations were provided by the HAL collaboration 
and the Strategic Programs for Innovative Research (SPIRE) Field 5 "The 
origin of matter and the universe".
